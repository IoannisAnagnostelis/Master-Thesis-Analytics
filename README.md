# Master Thesis: Enhancing Retail Marketing through Customer Segmentation and Predictive Analytics

This repository contains the full R code, visual outputs, and final thesis PDF for my MSc in Data Science & Marketing Analytics at Erasmus University Rotterdam. The project explores how RFM, K-Means, and Random Forest can be used to segment customers and predict churn.

## 📘 Abstract
This study applies RFM analysis and K-Means clustering for fan segmentation, and builds a churn prediction model using Random Forest. A dual-layer clustering approach is used to derive marketing personas and target disengaged customers.
